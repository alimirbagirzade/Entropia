# Entropia — Stage 2 Handoff

> Living handoff for the staged build. Update the **Status** + **Next** sections as sub-stages land.

## Status — Stage 2 COMPLETE (as of Stage 2f merge)

`main` contains: **Stage 0 + 1 + 2 (a–f)**, all merged via green CI (backend lint/type/**integration on real Postgres**/alembic, frontend, docker). **Stage 2 (Data & Package Domain) is done — next is Stage 3 (Mainboard & External Work Objects).**

| Sub-stage | Page(s) | State | PR |
|-----------|---------|-------|----|
| 2a | Market Data (11) | ✅ merged | #1 |
| 2b | Research Data (12) | ✅ merged | #2 → #1 → main |
| 2c | ESP / Embedded System Packages (09) | ✅ merged | #3 |
| 2d | Rationale Families (10) | ✅ merged | #4 |
| 2e | Create Package + Pre-Check (06, 07) | ✅ merged | #5 |
| 2f | Package Library (08) | ✅ merged | #6 |

Alembic head: `0007_create_package_precheck` (unchanged — 2f is read-only, no new migration). Chain: …→0005_esp_packages→0006_rationale_families→0007_create_package_precheck.

## How each sub-stage is built (the working loop)

1. Branch off `main`: `feat/stage-2<x>-<slug>`.
2. Run a **Workflow** (author core → author app+tests → review) with the binding decisions + lessons below baked into the prompt.
3. Verify locally: `cd backend && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy src && uv run pytest --no-cov` (unit+contract pass; integration auto-skips without local Postgres).
4. **FK insert-order proof** for any new `create_*` (async probe with `uv run --with aiosqlite python`, JSONB→TEXT `@compiles` shim) — confirm `entity_registry` inserts before child rows.
5. Apply review CRITICAL/HIGH/cheap-MEDIUM fixes; commit.
6. PR → `main`; watch CI (`gh run watch <id> --exit-status`); merge with `gh pr merge <n> --merge --delete-branch` when green.

## Binding architecture (authoritative: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §131-133, DOMAIN_MODEL.md §1)

- `entity_registry` is the **universal Root** (one row per durable object, discriminated by `entity_type`). Per-domain **dedicated `*_revision` + detail/support tables** FK to `entity_registry.entity_id`. No EAV/generic-JSON for core domain; dependency/reference edges get normalized tables.
- Stage-1 soft-delete/restore/purge operate generically on `entity_registry` — keep them working.
- One generic `approval_decision` table (target_kind discriminator) for all approvals.
- Lifecycle/validation/approval/visibility are **separate facets** (CR-04), lowercase snake_case enums in `domain/<x>/enums.py` (+ shared in `domain/lifecycle/enums.py`).

## Hard-learned lessons (apply proactively — these caused real failures)

- **L1 FK insert order:** SQLAlchemy UOW does NOT order parent-before-child from a bare `ForeignKey` (no `relationship()` on `entity_registry`). Every `create_*` that makes a root + child in one flush must be **async**: add root → `await session.flush()` → add children. (Fixed in `create_market_dataset`, `create_research_dataset`, `create_package`.)
- **L2 Idempotency ordering:** put optimistic-concurrency (`check_row_version`/`check_head`) **and** state-machine legality checks **inside** the `run_idempotent` operation body — else a completed-key replay raises a spurious 409 instead of returning the cached result. Authorization + pure input validation stay outside.
- **L3 Role/page gating:** enforce server-side at route **and** service layer, per each page's doc. Read the doc's role matrix — e.g. Research Data page is Admin/Supervisor/Agent only (router gate); ESP list/detail are any-authenticated but activate/deprecate are Admin-only; the resolve endpoint requires `require_authenticated`. Contract tests must pick an actor that passes the page gate but fails the specific check, so the asserted error code is the intended one.
- **L4** No fabricated metrics (null/`not_applicable`, never 0). **L5** Pin exact `revision_id`+`content_hash` (never "latest"). **L6** Register every model in `models/__init__.py __all__`.
- **L7 Optimistic-token + check-before-mutate:** an `expected_*_version` token is **inert unless** every state-advancing op bumps the root `row_version` (and `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`-locks the root). Within the `run_idempotent` body, run legality/concurrency checks **before** any row mutation — 2e `approve_and_publish` first mutated then checked (and whitelisted states with no legal `→approved` edge); both fixed pre-merge.
- CI runs only on PRs whose **base is `main`** (push to non-main branches does not run CI). So land each stage via a PR → main.

## Reusable foundation (don't re-create)

`application/idempotency.py` (`run_idempotent` — now **per-principal scoped**: never replays another actor's cached result), `infrastructure/queues/enqueue.py` (`enqueue_job`/`send_job`, durable job row = source of truth, CR-09), `shared/manifest.py` (`manifest_hash`), `infrastructure/s3/datasets.py`, `repositories/approvals.py` (`add_approval_decision`), the shared **Package** model from 2c (`models/packages.py`, `repositories/packages.py` — `create_package` is async/FK-safe) which **2e reuses**, and the ESP resolver registry (`resolve_embedded_dependency`) which **2e Pre-Check consumes**.

## Known LOW follow-ups (tracked, not blocking)

- List endpoints (market/research/esp) compute `has_more`/cursor over the **post-visibility-filter** set → under-filled pages; push the visibility predicate into SQL.
- `queries/esp.py::_visibility_of` has an unused `root` param + misleading docstring.
- ESP soft-delete / `DELETE_POLICY_BLOCKED` deprecate-first guard deferred to a later stage.
- Research: derive-from-base market-link carry-forward; approve/revoke root `row_version` bump; idempotency keys on draft-edit endpoints.
- Consider aligning ESP audit `event_kind` to doc 09's `resolver.registry.activated`.
- Rationale family **name uniqueness is app-enforced only** (`find_active_or_reserved_by_name` + check inside `_op`); add a root-level denormalized active-name column + partial unique index for a DB-level backstop against concurrent same-name creation. Same gap as the no-cascade `package_rationale_assignment` table-version token (coarse; the per-row `expected_head_revision_id` is the real guard).
- 2e **candidate-generation compute + dependency-scan parsing are V1 stubs** (the durable rows, both state machines, resolver wiring, idempotency, concurrency, and audit/outbox are real); wire real generation + a real source-call scanner in a later stage. `dependency_scan` is already append-only with `attempt_no` to absorb re-scans.
- 2f **mutating catalog actions deferred** (read-only slice shipped): `Use in…`/`Create-Strategy-Draft` (needs Strategy drafts — Stage 3), `Derive`, `Export` (job/artifact pipeline), and `Deprecate`/`Approve & Publish` from the Library page — each its own future slice.
- 2f **`explicitly_shared` is readable by any authenticated actor** (mirrors `identity/policy.py::can_view`; no share-grant table yet). When a per-principal share list lands, tighten both `can_view` and `queries/library.py::_visibility_conditions` together.
- 2f deferred refinements: **market/timeframe-scope facets** (need a defined facet vocabulary + indexed columns) and **user-driven sort** (V1 is fixed newest-first by `entity_id`; performance sorts need linked runs from Stage 5); the catalog **list** row surfaces the *pinned* family name while **detail** resolves the live name (fold live name into list rows when an indexed family projection exists).

## Stage 2d — Rationale Families (doc 10) ✅ landed (#4)

Shared-edit exception (DOMAIN_MODEL §6): all four roles create/edit/rename/soft-delete any family + edit any assignment via `can_manage_rationale_families` / `can_edit_rationale_assignments` (NOT owner policy). `rationale_family_root` (detail + `display_color`) + immutable `rationale_family_revision` + `package_rationale_assignment` edge (`target_kind = package_revision | working_item_revision`), all entity_registry-anchored; `create_family` is async/FK-safe. Atomic all-or-nothing batch with `expected_table_version` + per-row `expected_head_revision_id` → `PACKAGE_RATIONALE_ASSIGNMENT_CONFLICT`; each changed assignment makes a new package revision (carrying contracts forward; package owner unchanged); identical resubmit = idempotent no-op; output mismatch = non-blocking `OUTPUT_TYPE_NOT_LISTED` warning. Assignment table renders the family's **current** name live (rename without re-pinning). 6 ACTIVE seed families behind `SEED_RATIONALE` (incl. `Embedded System / TA Resolver`). Migration `0006_rationale_families`. **Consumed by:** 2e Strategy required-family picker (ACTIVE roots only) + 2f Package Library family filter (`rationale_family_id` join).

## Stage 2e — Create Package + Pre-Check (docs 06, 07) ✅ landed (#5)

Reuses the shared **Package** model (2c `create_package`, async/FK-safe) + the ESP resolver registry (`resolve_embedded_dependency`). Two new entity_registry-anchored tables: `package_request` (mutable detail, optimistic `row_version`) + immutable append-only `dependency_scan` (`attempt_no`, `source_hash`/`context_hash` staleness anchors, JSONB detected/resolved/missing/unsupported calls). Command chain (all idempotent; concurrency + legality checks inside the body, **before** mutation — L2/L7): `create_package_request` → `run_precheck` (resolves each declared canonical TA call against the **live** 2c ESP registry, pins exact `revision_id`+`content_hash` — L5; blocked path on missing/untrusted) → `submit_candidate_generation` (Send gate re-checks precheck freshness + registry-race staleness) → `create_draft_from_candidate` (reuses 2c `create_package`) → `approve_and_publish` (**Admin-only**, CR-02, atomic head repoint). Non-Admins create requests only. Create-Package + Pre-Check state machines per DOMAIN_MODEL §3.2. Candidate-generation compute + scan parsing are honest **V1 stubs**; all durable rows, resolver wiring, per-principal idempotency, concurrency control, and audit/outbox are real. Migration `0007_create_package_precheck`. **Adversarial review fixed 3 issues pre-merge:** (1) `approve_and_publish` legality check hoisted before any mutation + approvable-state set reconciled to legal edges; (2) `package_request.row_version` now bumped on every state advance (+ root row lock) so `expected_request_version` is a live token; (3) per-principal idempotency isolation in shared `run_idempotent`. **Consumed by:** 2f Package Library (lists published packages; `dependency_scan` = "how this package was built" provenance).

## Stage 2f — Package Library (doc 08) ✅ landed (#6)

The catalog/discovery surface over the existing package schema — **read-only: no new migration, model, or command.** Reuses the shared **Package** model (2c), the 2d rationale snapshot, and 2e `package_request`/`dependency_scan` provenance. `domain/package/catalog.py` (filter parse/validate — CR-01 type guard, facet enums, lifecycle set, query cap) + `permissions.py` (the 10-flag projection, CR-02 Admin-only publish). `application/queries/library.py`: role-aware `list_packages` + `get_package_detail`; **visibility pushed into SQL** (ARCHITECTURE §9.5) — admin=all, else `published`/`system`/`explicitly_shared` OR owner — so `has_more`/cursor count the authorized set (fixed the market/research/esp under-fill pattern). Cursor newest-first by `entity_id`; facet filters (type/lifecycle/validation/approval/visibility/rationale-family+`unassigned`) + name ILIKE search. Detail = full contracts + dependency snapshot + **live** family name + 2e provenance + revision history; re-runs `can_view` (soft-deleted→404, foreign-private→403). Guests rejected (doc 08 §2); non-Strategy perf metrics N/A, never 0 (L4). `routes/library.py` thin GET handlers (list + detail+ETag), wired in `main.py`; `+CatalogFilterInvalid` (422). **Adversarial 4-dimension review: zero production defects;** the 5 confirmed MEDIUM test-coverage findings were fixed pre-merge, plus one production hardening (explicit `CATALOG_LIFECYCLE_STATES` in the list SQL).

## Next: Stage 3 — Mainboard & External Work Objects (docs 01–05)

Per `docs/STAGE_BUILD_PLAN.md` §"Stage 3" (M9–M10 + external-object subsystem, CR-01). Composition plane: **Mainboard (01)**, **Strategy Details (02)**, **Add Outsource Signal (03)**, **Trading Signal (04)**, **Trade Log (05)**. New entities: `mainboard_workspace`, `mainboard_working_item`, `work_object_root/revision`, `mainboard_composition_snapshot`, `strategy_root/editor_draft/revision/revision_references`, `trading_signal_root/revision`, `trade_log_root/revision`, `source_asset`, `import_job/report`, `normalized_signal_event_revision`, `canonical_trade_record_batch`.

**Binding rules to honor (Stage 3 acceptance):** `item_kind` strictly `{strategy, trading_signal, trade_log}` — kind mismatch → 422 (CR-01); Trading Signal / Trade Log are external `MainboardWorkingItem`s, **never** a `PackageKind` (the 2f catalog already excludes them). Pin by `root_id + revision_id` only (no name/latest/DOM). `composition_hash` changes on add/del/enable/pin → prior Ready report STALE; expand/collapse + label-only edits do **not** change the hash. `available_time` required, UTC, no lookahead. Immutable revisions, no auto-repin (except first Save&Add). Strategy save ≠ Ready PASS ≠ Run. Single-tx mutation+fingerprint+audit+outbox.

**Strong reuse from Stage 2:** the entity_registry Root + immutable revision chain, `run_idempotent` (per-principal), `enqueue_job`/durable jobs (CR-09 — Trading Signal/Trade Log import jobs on the `data` queue), `add_approval_decision`, audit/outbox, `shared/manifest.py`, and — crucially — **2f's `library_query` / catalog** (Strategy Details' "Use a Package" and "Create Strategy Draft from Package" consume the catalog read surface + pin exact package revisions). The 2f deferred `Use in…`/`Create-Strategy-Draft` actions become live once Strategy drafts exist here.

## Stage 3a — Mainboard (doc 01) ✅ in PR #7 (green CI, awaiting merge)

The composition plane only (Ready Check report = Stage 4, RUN/result = Stage 5, Strategy typed-config compiler = 3b, Signal/TradeLog import jobs = 3d/3e are OUT). Migration **`0008_mainboard_composition`** (chain →0007; new alembic head once merged). New tables: `mainboard_workspace` (entity_registry-anchored; kinds human_default/agent_research/system; `composition_hash`+`row_version`), `work_object_root`/`work_object_revision` (immutable, `content_hash`, `available_time`), `mainboard_working_item` (child: kind, pinned root+revision, position_index, is_enabled, display_label_override, row_version), `mainboard_composition_snapshot` (immutable; `readiness_report_id` null — Stage 4 fills). `MainboardItemKind` reused across 3 tables via `native_enum=False` (matches 0007). Endpoints (`/api/v1`): `GET /mainboards/default` (auto-create), `POST /strategy-drafts` + `/external-work-object-drafts/{kind}` (transient, no DB), `POST /work-objects` (+`/revisions`), `POST /mainboards/{id}/items`, `PATCH /mainboard-items/{id}`, `POST /mainboards/{id}/snapshots`, `DELETE /work-objects/{root_id}`.

**Decisions (binding):** `item_kind` server-derived from root `object_kind`, divergent client value → 422 (CR-01); pin exact `root_id`+`revision_id` (L5); no auto-repin on revision append (AT#5). `composition_hash` = `manifest_hash` over the sorted **ENABLED** `{kind,root,revision}` set → changes on add/del/enable/pin (prior report STALE), **unchanged** on reorder/label/expand-collapse (documented gap-resolution, doc 01 §5.2+§9.3). Single-tx mutation+fingerprint+audit+outbox; per-principal idempotency; FOR-UPDATE locks + `expected_row_version`/`expected_head_revision_id` inside the op (L2/L7); FK-safe async create (L1).

**Security design call (override of an auto-generated test + a reviewer's literal suggestion):** work objects have **no visibility/sharing facet and no publish path** in 3a (`create_work_object` always sets `lifecycle_state="active"`; that is a deletion/lifecycle facet, NOT publication — CR-04). So **all foreign work-object attach is denied** (owner/Admin only); deriving `published` from `lifecycle_state=="active"` (the market/research `_visibility_of` pattern) would make every work object foreign-attachable and re-open the CRITICAL leak. Cross-owner reuse is the **Package catalog** path (Add Package → derived Strategy Draft, 2f), not raw work-object attach.

**Adversarial 4-dim review → all fixed pre/at-merge:** CRITICAL foreign-private attach leak (hardcoded `explicitly_shared` → owner/Admin-only); HIGH soft-delete now idempotent no-op on already-deleted root, workspace `composition_hash` recompute now locks workspace + bumps `row_version` (live ETag, no lost update), pin_revision active-root check under the root lock (TOCTOU); MEDIUM idempotency fingerprints include `expected_head`/`source_provenance`. **CI Postgres caught one bug local SQLite masked:** 64-char `composition_hash` written into `audit_events.new_state` VARCHAR(48) → moved to JSONB metadata/outbox payload (`new_state=None`/`snapshot_id`). persistence/FK/migration dim: 0 findings.

**Tests:** 23 unit + 6 contract + 11 persistence + 6 authz integration; FK insert-order proof PASS; validated on local Postgres (17 mainboard integration green) + CI green.

**Known 3a follow-ups (tracked):** "one active default per human owner" app-enforced (no DB constraint — add denormalized owner col + partial unique idx later); `_assert_not_in_active_run` is a no-op stub (Stage 5 wires `OBJECT_IN_ACTIVE_RUN`); 3 LOW review notes (refresh-on-possibly-dirty, pre-lock item resolve, `or ""` owner fallback) deferred; work-object cross-owner sharing (visibility column + `_visibility_of`) deferred to whenever sharing lands; AT#9/11/12/14–18/20/22/24/25/28–30 depend on later stages.

## Next: Stage 3b — Strategy Details (doc 02)

Per `docs/STAGE_BUILD_PLAN.md` Stage 3 → Strategy Details row: `domain/strategy` (typed `StrategyConfig` compiler, sizing exclusivity, trigger source), `application/commands/strategy_draft`; endpoints `POST /strategy-drafts` (real persistence this time), `.patch/.set_reference/.add_node/.validate`, `POST /strategy-drafts/{id}/save` (201 → strategy_root/strategy_revision/`config_hash`, ready_state=STALE), `mainboard_item.pin_revision`; tables `strategy_root`, `strategy_editor_draft`, `strategy_revision`, `strategy_revision_references`. **Consumes 3a:** the Save flow produces a work-object-equivalent revision that `attach_mainboard_item` pins; the 2f catalog "Use a Package"/"Create Strategy Draft from Package" actions become live. Follow the working loop; FK insert-order proof for every new `create_*` (L1).
